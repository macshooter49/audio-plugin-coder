- **Windows installer improvements**
  - Changed to 64-bit installation mode (`ArchitecturesAllowed=x64compatible`)
  - Installer now suggests `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\` instead of x86 folder
  - Added icon.ico to installation files for uninstall display
  - Fixed `UninstallDisplayIcon` to show plugin icon in Windows "Add or Remove Programs"
  - Build script (`build-and-install.ps1`) now automatically embeds icons post-build

### Fixed
- WebView UI integration for CloudWash
- Parameter binding between C++ backend and JavaScript frontend

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

#### Cross-Platform Build System (Ship Workflow Improvement)
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** for automated cross-platform builds
  - `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` - Release builds for Windows, macOS, Linux
  - `.github/workflows/build-pr.yml` - PR validation with automatic plugin detection
  - Platform selection support (Windows, macOS, Linux, or combinations)
  - Manual workflow dispatch with dropdown options
  - Automatic artifact packaging and GitHub Release creation

- **CMake Cross-Platform Support**
  - Platform detection in root `CMakeLists.txt` (Windows/macOS/Linux)
  - Platform-specific plugin format selection:
    - Windows: VST3, Standalone
    - macOS: VST3, AU, Standalone (Universal Binary)
    - Linux: VST3, LV2, Standalone
  - WebView backend selection per platform (WebView2, WKWebView, WebKitGTK)
  - macOS Universal Binary support (Intel + Apple Silicon)
  - Updated all plugin CMakeLists.txt files (CloudWash, AngelGrain, nf_gnarly, gnarly2)

- **Windows Installer Creation**
  - Inno Setup installer template (`scripts/installer/installer-template.iss`)
  - PowerShell installer generation script (`scripts/installer/create-windows-installer.ps1`)
  - License agreement (EULA) integration
  - Custom installation path selection
  - Component selection (VST3, Standalone, Presets, Documentation)
  - Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts
  - Uninstaller with complete removal

- **Documentation**
  - `docs/README.md` - Main documentation with build system overview
  - `docs/github-actions.md` - Detailed GitHub Actions usage guide
  - `docs/ship-workflow.md` - Ship phase documentation with platform selection
  - `docs/installer-creation.md` - Installer creation guide for all platforms
  - `templates/CMakeLists.txt.template` - Template for new plugins
  - `templates/LICENSE.txt.template` - EULA template for installers

### Changed
- **Ship Workflow** (`.kilocode/workflows/ship.md`)
  - Added platform selection prompt (local vs GitHub Actions)
  - Hybrid build approach (use local build + GitHub for other platforms)
  - Support for selective platform building to save CI minutes
  - Updated to reference detailed skill documentation

  - Complete rewrite with cross-platform support
  - Step-by-step implementation guide
  - Platform detection and user interaction logic

### Known Limitations / Future Work

The following features were designed but not fully implemented:

- **Phase 4: macOS Installer Creation** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - Requires macOS for DMG/PKG creation (`hdiutil`, `pkgbuild`, `productbuild`)
  - Code signing requires Apple Developer certificate
  - Can be built on macOS using prepared structure from GitHub artifacts
  - **TODO**: Add macOS installer creation to GitHub Actions workflow

- **Phase 5: Linux Package Creation** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - Requires Linux for AppImage/DEB creation (`appimagetool`, `dpkg-deb`)
  - Can be built on Linux using prepared structure from GitHub artifacts
  - **TODO**: Add Linux package creation to GitHub Actions workflow

- **GitHub Actions Installer Creation** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - Current workflow creates ZIP distributions only
  - Windows installer (.exe) created locally via PowerShell script
  - **TODO**: Add installer creation steps to GitHub Actions for all platforms
  - This would enable fully automated release with installers

- **GitHub Actions Build Failures** - KNOWN ISSUES
  - macOS build fails: `JUCEModuleSupport.cmake` not found during CMake configuration
  - Linux build fails: `libwebkit2gtk` package compatibility issues on Ubuntu 24.04
  - **TODO**: Fix submodule checkout and WebKit package dependencies for CI builds
  - Windows builds are working correctly
